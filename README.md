# Sample for init env in projects

```
python3 -m venv env
. env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# gitignore
The **/ pattern means "this pattern will be matched in the current directory and any subdirectory", so it will work for all nested Python projects.
For example, this will ignore:

```
python/project1/env/
python/project1/subproject/env/
python/project2/env/
python/deep/nested/project/env/
```

# Output example.
- Make sure pytest is able to run: `pytest calculator_test.py -v`

- Mutation testing: `mutmut run` (without `pyproject.toml` we have to run: `mutmut run --paths-to-mutate calculator.py`)
```
- Mutation testing starting -

These are the steps:
1. A full test suite run will be made to make sure we
   can run the tests successfully and we know how long
   it takes (to detect infinite loops for example)
2. Mutants will be generated and checked

Results are stored in .mutmut-cache.
Print found mutants with `mutmut results`.

Legend for output:
🎉 Killed mutants.   The goal is for everything to end up in this bucket.
⏰ Timeout.          Test suite took 10 times as long as the baseline so were killed.

 def divide(a: int, b: int) -> float:

# Explain on mutation fix xD
how the `test_divide` function tests the `divide` function, focusing on each test case:

```python
def test_divide():
    # Test case 1: Normal division
    assert divide(6, 2) == 3.0  # Tests if 6/2 gives exactly 3.0
    assert divide(5, 2) == 2.5  # Tests if 5/2 gives exactly 2.5
    
    # Test case 2: Division by zero error
    try:
        divide(1, 0)           # Try to divide 1 by 0
        pytest.fail("Expected ValueError")  # If we reach here, test should fail
    except ValueError as e:    # Catch the specific ValueError
        assert str(e) == "Cannot divide by zero"  # Verify exact error message
```

Let's break down what happens in each case:

1. **Normal Division Cases**:
   - `divide(6, 2) == 3.0`: Tests whether 6÷2 equals 3.0
   - `divide(5, 2) == 2.5`: Tests whether 5÷2 equals 2.5
   - These verify that regular division works correctly

2. **Division by Zero Case**:
   ```python
   try:
       divide(1, 0)  # This line triggers the ValueError in divide()
   ```
   When `b = 0`, the divide function hits this code:
   ```python
   if b == 0:
       raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")
   ```

   The test then:
   ```python
   except ValueError as e:
       assert str(e) == "Cannot divide by zero"
   ```
   - Catches the ValueError
   - Checks if the error message exactly matches "Cannot divide by zero"
   - If the message is different (like "XXCannot divide by zeroXX" in the mutation), the test fails

This test is now comprehensive because it verifies:
1. Correct results for valid divisions
2. That division by zero raises an error
3. The exact error message content

The mutation test previously survived because we weren't checking the error message content. Now we are, so any change to the message will cause the test to fail.

- Run again with cache clear to see the no survivors xD:
```bash
rm .mutmut-cache && mutmut run 
```

- Expected output:
```
